	At Wave Gymnastics our goal is to empower children to become more fit and focused, and improve their overall health. Our objective is to improve childrenâ€™s self-esteem and promote physical fitness and a love for all sports, by teaching athletes in a respectful and friendly environment. Wave gymnastics strives to offer a competitive experience for all students no matter their skill level. We also offer an extensive recreational program for children who love gymnastics but do not want to be competitive. We offer gymnastics and fitness equipment for both boys age 1-7 and girls 1-18. Wave Gymnastics offers a place where children can learn gymnastics, meet new people, have fun and feel comfortable. We offer a varied gymnastics and conditioning program with price options for all levels of interest, and a greater emphasis on group classes. Our instructors have access to continual training with some of the area's top professional coaches, Angie Bryner and Tina Buscemi our founders. This provides our students with up-to-date skills and technique. Wave Gymnastics welcomes a diversity of people and believe in a philosophy of working for the benefit of the whole child.
